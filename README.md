# Bullet Journal

I made this bullet journal because I wanted to build something digital where I could keep track of my to-dos as well as my mood and notes from the day. When I have a rough day or I'm feeling down I tend to let that negativity effect everything else. One bad day leads me into thinking all my recent days have been bad. When I struggle through a day it feels like I haven't grown at all.

So I made this as a place to look back on my progress and stay consistent in my growth and good habits.
